## Business Manager 101
Meta Business Accounts bring together things like Facebook Pages, Instagram account and the people who work on them so you can manage them all in one place

### Businesses
* under "Users", you can view all the people associated with the business
* each user is assigned various assets. For example, Bob might only have access to an ad account for the business. Alice might have access to the ad account and Instagram account.
* under "Accounts", you can see the associated Facebook Pages, ad accounts, aps, Instagram accounts, or WhatsApp accounts.
