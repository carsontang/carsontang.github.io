# Building OBS Studio (Windows 10, 64-bit)
* Download Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
* Download the VS2017 dependencies zip file: https://obsproject.com/downloads/dependencies2017.zip.
* Extract the contents of the zip file to `C:\obs-deps`
* Download Qt version >= 5.9, and install in `C:\Qt`
* Follow the official OBS Studio Windows install instructions here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Install-Instructions#windows-build-directions.
* Open up `cmake-gui`.
* `Where is the source code`: `/path/to/obs-studio`
* `Where to build the binaries`: `/path/to/newly/created/build/directory`
* Click `+ Add Entry`. Add the following entries:
  * `DepsPath`, `PATH`, `C:\obs-deps\win64\include`
  * `QTDIR64`, `PATH`, `C:\Qt\5.x\msvc2017_64`
  * `(Optional) FFmpegPath`, `PATH`, `C:\obs-deps\win64\include`
  * `(Optional) x264Path`, `PATH`, `C:\obs-deps\win64\include`
  * `(Optional) curlPath`, `PATH`, `C:\obs-deps\win64\include`
* Press `Configure`. **IMPORTANT** Select the generator corresponding to both Visual Studio 2017 **and** Win64, `Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64`. If you don't select the Win64 version, the build won't work properly because you'll be targeting a 32-bit architecture.
* Press `Generate`.
* Go to the `build` directory that you specified. Open up `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj`.
* In the `Solution Explorer`, right click the Solution called `obs-studio`. Click `Build Solution`.
* Once the `Output` window indicates that the `Build: 41 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped`, go to `/path/to/build/rundir/Debug/bin/64bit/`. Inside, you'll find `obs64`. Open that executable file to run OBS Studio. Congrats!

# Building OBS Studio (macOS)
```
cd obs-studio
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```

If this doesn't work, you might need to set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`: https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues/205
