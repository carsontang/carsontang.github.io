These days a lot of young people would climb up to the rooftops and shout about the importance of political and economic reforms. But is this what they should focus on? People may criticize me because of my position. "Why are you not promoting political reform?" I would say: "Is there anything you can do about it?" So what if we changed the system? And most of the people who asked this question already have foreign passports. It's easy for them to flee the country. They don't have to be responsible for any consequences. We need to turn our dreams into the dreams of our society and nation.

As a general rule of thumb, then, growing industries with relatively low start-up costs offer more opportunities for those who want to get rich than declining industries, or those that require huge start-up investment.

Success is waking up in the morning, whoever you are, wherever you are, however old or young, and bouncing out of bed because there's something out there you love to do, that you believe in, that you're good at -- something that's bigger than you are, and you can hardly wait to get at it again today.

When I followed Joshua to visit the Computer Science building, he pointed at a vending machine and said, "This is connected with the internal network of our school so that you can check from any computer on campus to see if your favorite drink is available. Those guys (Ph.D. students in Computer Science) are lazy. They want to know what drinks and snacks are available in the machine when they are in their dorm rooms. That’s why they spent two weeks figuring out how to install a chip in the machine. This way they won’t come here for nothing."

If I go out there and miss game winners, and people say, "Kobe choked, or Kobe is seven for whatever in pressure situations." Well, [expletive] you. Because I don’t play for your [expletive] approval. I play for my own love and enjoyment of the game. And to win. That’s what I play for. Most of the time, when guys feel the pressure, they’re worried about what people might say about them. I don’t have that fear, and it enables me to forget bad plays and to take shots and play my game.

*Kobe Bryant*

Indeed, a bad habit is the last thing that most of us are afraid of. We think that we are acting always from our own choice, that it is no matter what we do now, because another time, whenever we wish, we can do differently. But all the while a certain habit is forming and hardening, until at last we find ourselves almost helpless. Thus, even our tastes, our amusements, our selection of books, the tendency even of our most secret thoughts, are becoming fixed, and we are becoming permanently the persons we meant to be only for the moment.

*on bad habits*

We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

If you’re not trying to bust your own idea, you think the idea is working out and you don’t look at the challenges.


Our society idolizes the genius who stares at a whiteboard, but to farm good ideas, work in the trenches and generally that’s where your insights will come from.

Put yourself in an environment where your mind will be consistently stimulated.

You get the good ideas by being down in the mud and working on the problems. It’s the hard work that leads you to the insights that are hopefully the great ideas...Everybody loves the idea of the lone inventor that has the brilliant idea, they patent it, they get rich afterward...these memes run through our culture in different ways.

The man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The man who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been before. Creativity in living is not without its attendant difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt. And the unfortunate thing about being ahead of your time is that when people finally realize you were right, they’ll say it was obvious all along. You have two choices in life: You can dissolve into the mainstream, or you can be distinct. To be distinct is to be different. To be different, you must strive to be what no one else but you can be.

The most common strategy with guys who are inexperienced with women is "to be liked by all; hated by none". This is a horrible strategy. You have to either make the decision to accept being controversial and confrontational or you need to accept that you will go through life with everyone being neutral towards you. You CANNOT be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others. You have to polarize.

*Mark Manson*

[Google] uses a metric. Take our very best programmer. Suppose we had a choice. Either we could lose that programmer, or we could lose our N worst programmers. It’s either worst or average, I don’t remember which one, but N other programmers. How big is N when that balances? And he said at Google the answer is about 300.
